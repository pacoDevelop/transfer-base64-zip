# transfer-base64-zip
This project provides a simple Node.js script to convert ZIP files to Base64 and vice versa. It allows you to transform ZIP files into a Base64 string for easy transfer, database storage, or transmission over text-only channels, and also to reconstruct them back into their original format.
